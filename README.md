# Hi 👋 I’m Ranjana Bongale Ganesh

**Software Engineer focused on building reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient cloud-based systems, with an emphasis on maintainability and clean system design.**

I’ve worked across large scale distributed systems, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud infrastructure, and I enjoy projects where I can own problems end-to-end — from design to deployment.
